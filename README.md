# Gender_And_Age_Detection

This project uses OpenCV and deep learning models to detect faces through a webcam in real-time and predict the gender and age group of each detected person. The detected face is highlighted with a bounding box, and the predicted gender and age label is displayed on the live video feed. 

It is built using pre-trained Caffe models and OpenCV’s DNN module. The entire process runs live using your system’s webcam. This project is based on a tutorial by KNOWLEDGE DOCTOR and uses models provided by LearnOpenCV.
